# MarbleRacing.Rocks

Hello! Welcome to the repository for the website of MarbleRacing.Rocks. This website is dedicated to showcasing our partners on YouTube that expand the sport of Marble Racing for everyone to enjoy! 

This website is brought to you by volunteers of the International Marble Sports Commitee (IMC). We do this work for free because we love the sport of Marble Racing. Many of us are content creators, writers, and more! Please be patient with us, as we are all doing this in our freetime.

**[If you are an IMC member joining us from the old website, please click here to join our member organization](https://github.com/marbleracing-rocks).**

## Installing

```bash
# With Gatsby CLI
gatsby new gatsby-starter-ghost https://github.com/TryGhost/gatsby-starter-ghost.git
```

```bash
# From Source
git clone https://github.com/TryGhost/gatsby-starter-ghost.git
cd gatsby-starter-ghost
```

Then install dependencies

```bash
yarn
```

&nbsp;

## Running

Start the development server. You now have a Gatsby site pulling content from headless Ghost.

```bash
gatsby develop
```

By default, the starter will populate content from a default Ghost install located at https://gatsby.ghost.io.

To use your own install, edit the `.ghost.json` config file with your credentials. You can find your `contentApiKey` in the "Integrations" screen in Ghost Admin. The minimum required version for Ghost is `2.10.0` in order to use this starter without issues.

## Extra options

```bash
# Run a production build, locally
gatsby build

# Serve a production build, locally
gatsby serve
```

Gatsby `develop` uses the `development` config in `.ghost.json` - while Gatsby `build` uses the `production` config.
